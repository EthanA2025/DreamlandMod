# DreamlandMod
Balatro Mod that adds 10 simple jokers
My first created mod and mostly for testing out how it works
Aimed to be more vanilla style jokers to have fun with
Eventual goal could be 20!

Ver 1.1.0 Updates

# Gameplay
Ocean Blue changed from 50 -> 35 chips per upgrade 
Think this one was too good considering you don't have to do anything to upgrade it 

Added 2 New Jokers!

Destroy 2 random cards in your hand
